abstract: HotFlip is a topical gradient-based word substitution method for attacking language models. Recently, this method has been further applied to attack retrieval systems by generating malicious passages that are injected into a corpus, i.e., corpus poisoning. However, HotFlip is known to be computationally inefficient, with the majority of time being spent on gradient accumulation for each query-passage pair during the adversarial token generation phase, making it impossible to generate an adequate number of adversarial passages in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, the attack method itself assumes access to a set of user queries, a strong assumption that does not correspond to how real-world adversarial attacks are usually performed. In this paper, we first significantly boost the efficiency of HotFlip, reducing the adversarial generation process from 4 hours per document to only 15 minutes, using the same hardware. We further contribute experiments and analysis on two additional tasks, (1) transfer-based black-box attacks, and (2) query-agnostic attacks. Whenever possible, we provide comparisons between the original method and our improved version. Our experiments demonstrate that HotFlip can effectively attack a variety of dense retrievers, with an observed trend that its attack performance diminishes against more advanced and recent methods. Interestingly, we observe that while HotFlip performs poorly in a black-box setting, indicating limited capacity for generalization, in query-agnostic scenarios its performance is correlated to the volume of injected adversarial passages.
